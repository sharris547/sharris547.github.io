		<p>Welcome to this website. My favorite type of food is dessert. My favorite kind of dessert is chocolate cake. 
		Chocolate cake always seems to warm the soul on any day, especially if it paired with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. What makes chocolate cake so great is its presentation. 
		I love intricate and interesting icing designs that seem to complete a cake. Anything from vanilla frosting, chocolate, marble, and peanut butter icing always pairs very well with any kind of chocolate cake. 
		If you are in the mood for cake, I would suggest Café Intermettzo in Midtown or Gigi’s Cupcakes here in Athens, Ga. Publix and Fresh Market also has a good selection of cakes. 
		You can get a whole cake or just a slice, depending on how much you want. Cake has a way of bringing people together. At any party or event, cake is always expected and it will always make everyone happy and satisfied.</p>
		
		<h2>Here's a list of times when cake is super good to eat</h2>
